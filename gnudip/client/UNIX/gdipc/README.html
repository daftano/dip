<hr>

<p>
This is the Linux/UNIX Client Package for GnuDIP Release 2.3.

<p>
The GnuDIP software implements a Dynamic IP DNS service.
It provides clients with a static DNS name even if
their IP address is dynamically assigned.

<p>
GnuDIP is written in <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>.

<p>
GnuDIP has two main parts on the server side:
<ul>
<li>
a daemon that listens for client requests and
<li>
a web interface that is used as the administration tool
and as the user's tool to manage their own account.
</ul>

<p>
With this client you can have your IP address updated automatically at
several GnuDIP sites simultaneously. This client will only send an update
to the GnuDIP servers if the IP address at the time of the last update
is no longer valid, or enough time has expired. The validity of the old
address is determined without generating any network traffic.

<p>
GnuDIP is released under the GPL. Please see the file
<a href="COPYING"><code>COPYING</code></a>
included in this distribution for more information.

<p><hr>

<p>
As mentioned, GnuDIP is written in
<a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>.
More specifically, the requirements for this client are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/info/software.html">
the base Perl Language system</a>
</ul>

<p>
If you have a recent
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>
or such, Perl will probably be available on your installation CD.

<p>
This client comes with the Perl
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Digest-Perl-MD5">
Digest-Perl-MD5 module</a>, a pure Perl
replacement for the Perl
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Digest-MD5">
Digest-MD5 module</a>, which does the MD5 calculation
in compiled binary code. The faster Digest-MD5 module will be used
if it is installed, otherwise the pure Perl Digest-Perl-MD5 module
will be used.

<p>
As with the base Perl system, the Digest-MD5 module will
probably be available on your installation CD.
If not, you can check the support Web site for your OS distribution,
to see whether a more recent Perl binary package has Digest-MD5.

<p>
To install
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Digest-MD5">
the CPAN Digest-MD5 package</a>
requires the <code>make</code> utility, the C compiler and the linker
for your system to be installed.
