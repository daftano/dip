<p>
This is the Windows Client Package for GnuDIP Release 2.3.

<p>
The GnuDIP software implements a Dynamic IP DNS service.
It provides clients with a static DNS name even if
their IP address is dynamically assigned.

<p>
GnuDIP is written in <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>.

<p>
GnuDIP has two main parts on the server side:
<ul>
<li>
a daemon that listens for client requests and
<li>
a web interface that is used as the administration tool
and as the user's tool to manage their own account.
</ul>

<p>
With this client you can have your IP address updated automatically at
several GnuDIP sites simultaneously. This client will only send an update
to the GnuDIP servers if the IP address at the time of the last update
is no longer valid, or enough time has expired. The validity of the old
address is determined without generating any network traffic.

<p>
GnuDIP is released under the GPL. Please see the file
<a href="COPYING"><code>COPYING</code></a>
