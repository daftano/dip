<hr>

<p>
This is release 2.3.5++ of the GnuDIP Web Interface.

<p>
The GnuDIP software implements a Dynamic IP DNS service.
It provides clients with a static DNS name even if
their IP address is dynamically assigned.

<p>
At the time of writing, this software may be obtained from
<a href="http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.

<p><hr>

<blockquote>
<p>
For the most part, the GnuDIP Web Interface is self-explanatory. Only a few
points are discussed here.
</blockquote>

<h3>The "Login" Page</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
If there is no "Self Register" button, the site operator has chosen not to
provide this capability.
</blockquote>

<h3>The "Self Registration" Page</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
A GnuDIP site may provide an alternative "Self Registration"
page. The following description is for the standard GnuDIP page.
<p>
You must choose a domain from the list. The host name you enter will
be within that domain. Your fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
will be "Hostname.Domain".
</blockquote>

<h3>The "User Options" Page</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The button labeled "Set Quick Login URL" can be used to
create a new Internet Explorer "favorite", Netscape "bookmark" or
Windows "desktop short cut icon" that will allow you to go directly to the
User Options page without logging in to the GnuDIP Web Interface.
</blockquote>

<h3>The "Current Settings" Page</h3>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
If any of the three items below are not present, the site operator has
chosen not to provide this capability.
</blockquote>

<dl>

<dt>
Wild Card
<dd>
A user may select the option to have a <b>wildcard DNS CNAME zone record</b> for their domain.
So for example they may put "<code>www.</code>" in front of their domain name and have this
resolve to the same IP address.

<p>
<dt>
Mail Exchanger
<dd>
A user may specify a domain to use as a <b>mail exchanger on a DNS MX zone record</b>.
Mail Transfer Agents (MTA-s) will send E-mail for the user's domain to the mail exchanger
domain host rather than the user's domain host. The user must make arrangements for the
mail to be accepted there.

<p>
<dt>
Backup Mail Exchanger
<dd>
A user may specify that the <b>mail exchanger is only for backup</b> use. Another MX record with
higher priority pointing at the user's domain host will be added. MTA-s will attempt to use the
higher priority MX record first. If the user's domain host does not respond, the MTA will send to
the mail exchanger host.
