<p>
We list here Gnudip client software packages from the current GnuDIP project,
Mike Machado's original GnuDIP project and from third party developers.

<p>
The protocols that these clients use to update IP addresses on a GnuDIP
server are described in <a href="protocol.html">protocol.html</a>.

<h3>
Client Software From Current GnuDIP Project
</h3>

<blockquote>
Note that there may be an updated version of the GnuDIP client at
<a href="http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/gnudip-www/latest/gnudip/html/clients.html">
SourceForge</a>.
</blockquote>

<ul>

<li>Linux/UNIX client package

<p>
You can <b>download or browse</b> this package from:

<blockquote>
<a href="client/UNIX/">client/UNIX/</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>
The directory contains a tar ball and a directory which is the unpacked tar ball.

<p><li>Windows client package

<p>
This package requires the prior separate installation of
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a>.
You can <b>download or browse</b> this package from:

<blockquote>
<a href="client/Windows/">client/Windows/</a>
</blockquote>

The directory has a Windows self-extracting zip executable file and 
a directory which is the unzipped self-extracting zip file.

<p><li>stand alone Windows client package

<p>
ActivePerl takes up about 50 meg of disk space, and most of this is not needed by the
client script. So there is a separate version of the Windows client package,
<b>with the necessary files from ActivePerl included</b> with it. It should be
easier to install. You can <b>download or browse</b> this package from:

<blockquote> 
<a href="client/Windows_standalone/">client/Windows_standalone/</a> 
</blockquote> 
  
The directory has a Windows self-extracting zip executable file and 
a directory which is the unzipped self-extracting zip file.

<h3>
Client Software Written by Others
</h3>
<ul>

<li> 
<a href="http://www.noeld.com/dldynsite.htm">DynSite</a>

<p>
This software is for Windows.

<p>
For GnuDIP sites at release 2.2.0 and earlier, this client
uses an unofficial update interface involving "spoofing" the web tool.
Authors of programs to update multiple dynamic DNS sites often do this.
In release 2.3.0, the web tool's security was greatly improved, and this
type of spoofing is no longer possible.

<p>
This client also supports the new HTTP update protocol used with releases
from 2.3.4 onwards.

<p>
<li> 
<a href="http://www.directupdate.net/">DirectUpdate</a>

<p>
This software is for Windows.

<p>
This client supports the TCP update protocol.

<p><li> 
<a href="http://www.gusnet.cx/proj/ez-ipupdate/">ez-ipupdate</a>

<p>
This software is for Linux/UNIX.

<p><li> 
<a href="http://woogie.net/linksysmon/">linksysmon</a>

<p>
This is not actually a GnuDIP client. It
"is a tool for monitoring Linksys BEFSR41 and BEFSR11 firewalls".
According to its home page "it can detect external IP address changes
(if you are using either DHCP or PPPOE) and can call an external program to
process the change".

<p>
The ez-ipupdate home page recommends it. This author has not used it, but it
could probably be used to detect an IP address change on a Linksys device and
call the GnuDIP client. This would be an alternative to the GnuDIP client's
IP address change detection mechanism, which is to "ping" the address with UDP
packets sent to itself.

<p>
This software is for Linux/UNIX.

<p><li>
<u>DynClient</u>

<p>
This software is for Windows.

<p>
This client is open source software written in Delphi.

<p>
It is available from
<a href="http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/dynclient/">
http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/dynclient/</a>
or from its author's site at
<a href="http://www.andrearusso.it/Client/Client.html">
http://www.andrearusso.it/Client/Client.htm</a>
. The author's site is written in Italian.

<p><li> 
<a href="http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/yoshihiro_e/dice/index.html">DiCE</a>

<p>
Most of the text on this page is in Japanese.

<p>
This software is for Windows and Linux.
