It provides\r\nclients with a static DNS name even if their IP address is dynamically\r\nassigned.\r\n\r\nGnuDIP is written in [Perl](http://www.perl.com/).\r\n\r\nGnuDIP has two main parts on the server side:\r\n\r\n-   a daemon that listens for client requests and\r\n-   a web interface that is used as the administration tool and as the\r\n    user's tool to manage their own account.\r\n\r\nA client which works with both Linux/UNIX and Windows is also provided.\r\n\r\nGnuDIP is released under the GPL. Please see the file\r\n[`COPYING`](COPYING) included in this distribution for more information.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe client Perl script, for Linux/UNIX, may be found in the directory:\r\n\r\n> [gnudip/client/UNIX/](gnudip/client/UNIX/).\r\n\r\nThe directory above has a tar ball for the latest release, and a\r\ndirectory which is just the unpacked tar ball which you can browse\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nUsing the client with Linux/UNIX is described in the file\r\n[`gnudip/client/UNIX/gdipc/CLIENT.html`](gnudip/client/UNIX/gdipc/CLIENT.html).\r\n\r\nThe same client Perl script, but with minor changes to adapt it to the\r\nWindows environment, may be found in the directory:\r\n\r\n> [gnudip/client/Windows/](gnudip/client/Windows/).\r\n\r\nThe directory above has a Windows self-extracting zip executable file\r\nand a directory which is just the expanded zip file which you can browse\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nTo use this software you must first install\r\n[ActivePerl](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/).\r\nThis software is a free port of Perl to Windows\r\n\r\nUsing the client with Windows is described in the file\r\n[`gnudip/client/Windows/gdipc/CLIENT.html`](gnudip/client/Windows/gdipc/CLIENT.html).\r\n\r\nA version of the Windows client package containing enough files from\r\nActivePerl to run stand alone may be found in the directory:\r\n\r\n> [gnudip/client/Windows\\_standalone/](gnudip/client/Windows_standalone/).\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the requirements are:\r\n\r\n-   [the base Perl Language\r\n    system](http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/info/software.html)\r\n-   the `nsupdate` command from either [BIND\r\n    8](http://isc.org/products/BIND/bind8.html) or [BIND\r\n    9](http://isc.org/products/BIND/bind9.html)\r\n-   the `sendmail` command from [Sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org/) or\r\n    the clone program provided by Sendmail replacements such as\r\n    [Exim](http://www.exim.org/), [qmail](http://qmail.org/) or\r\n    [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/).\r\n\r\nMore specifically you need Perl version 5.6.0 or later. You can use Perl\r\n5.005 if you are prepared to install a \"dummy\" `warnings.pm` file. This\r\nis explained in [`INSTALL.html`](INSTALL.html).\r\n\r\nTo use secret key rather than IP address access control for dynamic DNS\r\nyou may also want the `dnskeygen` command from BIND 8 or the\r\n`dnssec-keygen` command from BIND 9, to generate input files for\r\nnsupdate, and probably the key values in them.\r\n\r\nAlthough not required, GnuDIP will run a bit faster if you install [the\r\nPerl Digest-MD5 module](http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Digest-MD5).\r\n\r\nIn order to use [MySQL](http://mysql.com/) rather than the Linux/UNIX\r\nfile system for Web Tool configuration and user information, you will\r\nalso need:\r\n\r\n-   [the MySQL database management\r\n    software](http://mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html)\r\n-   [the Perl DBI module](http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBI)\r\n-   [the DBI MySQL\r\n    driver](http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBD::mysql)\r\n\r\nIn order to use [PostreSQL](http://postgresql.com/) rather than the\r\nLinux/UNIX file system for Web Tool configuration and user information,\r\nyou will also need:\r\n\r\n-   [the PostreSQL database management\r\n    software](http://www.postgresql.com/mirrors-ftp.html)\r\n-   [the Perl DBI module](http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBI)\r\n-   [the DBI PostgreSQL\r\n    driver](http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/dbdpg/projdisplay.php)\r\n\r\nIf you have [Linux](http://www.kernel.org/),\r\n[OpenBSD](http://openbsd.org/) or such, Perl (including the DBI module),\r\nBIND and Sendmail will probably be available as options from your\r\ninstallation CD. You may need to obtain and install the rest.\r\n\r\nRead [`INSTALL.html`](INSTALL.html) for instructions on installing\r\nGnuDIP.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nChanges since Release 2.1.2 are discussed in the file\r\n[`release.html`](release.html).\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe protocol used between the client and the update server is described\r\nin the file [gnudip/html/protocol.html](gnudip/html/protocol.html).\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThis package includes a bare bones version of GnuDIP with no database or\r\nweb tool. There is a single configuration file, which includes the list\r\nof host names and their passwords.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nRelease 2.3 of GnuDIP was written by Creighton MacDonnell.\r\nThis software is derived from GnuDIP Release 2.1.2, which was the work of Mike Machado.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
