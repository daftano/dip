<hr>

<p>
This is GnuDIP Release 2.3.5.

<p>
The GnuDIP software implements a Dynamic IP DNS service.
It provides clients with a static DNS name even if
their IP address is dynamically assigned.

<p>
GnuDIP is written in
<a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>.

<p>
GnuDIP has two main parts on the server side:
<ul>
<li>
a daemon that listens for client requests and
<li>
a web interface that is used as the administration tool
and as the user's tool to manage their own account.
</ul>

<p>
A client which works with both Linux/UNIX and Windows is also provided.

<p>
GnuDIP is released under the GPL. Please see the file
<a href="COPYING"><code>COPYING</code></a>
included in this distribution for more information.

<p><hr>

<p>
The client Perl script, for Linux/UNIX, may be found in the directory:

<blockquote> 
<a href="gnudip/client/UNIX/">gnudip/client/UNIX/</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p>
The directory above has a tar ball for the latest release, and a 
directory which is just the unpacked tar ball which you can browse 
through. 

<p>
Using the client with Linux/UNIX is described in the file
<a href="gnudip/client/UNIX/gdipc/CLIENT.html"><code>gnudip/client/UNIX/gdipc/CLIENT.html</code></a>.

<p>
The same client Perl script, but with minor changes to adapt it to the
Windows environment, may be found in the directory:

<blockquote> 
<a href="gnudip/client/Windows/">gnudip/client/Windows/</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p>
The directory above has a Windows self-extracting zip executable file
and a directory which is just the expanded zip file which you can browse 
through. 

<p>
To use this software you must first install 
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a>. 
This software is a free port of Perl to Windows

<p>
Using the client with Windows is described in the file
<a href="gnudip/client/Windows/gdipc/CLIENT.html"><code>gnudip/client/Windows/gdipc/CLIENT.html</code></a>.

<p>
A version of the Windows client package containing enough files from ActivePerl
to run stand alone may be found in the directory:

<blockquote> 
<a href="gnudip/client/Windows_standalone/">gnudip/client/Windows_standalone/</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><hr>

<p>
More specifically, the requirements are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/info/software.html">
the base Perl Language system</a>
<li>
the <code>nsupdate</code> command from either 
<a href="http://isc.org/products/BIND/bind8.html">BIND 8</a>
or
<a href="http://isc.org/products/BIND/bind9.html">BIND 9</a>
<li>
the <code>sendmail</code> command from
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a>
or the clone program provided by Sendmail replacements such as
<a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a>,
<a href="http://qmail.org/">qmail</a> or
<a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>.
</ul>

<p>
More specifically you need Perl version 5.6.0 or later. You can use Perl
5.005 if you are prepared to install a "dummy" <code>warnings.pm</code>
file. This is explained in
<a href="INSTALL.html"><code>INSTALL.html</code></a>.

<p>
To use secret key rather than IP address access control for dynamic DNS
you may also want the <code>dnskeygen</code> command from BIND 8 or the
<code>dnssec-keygen</code> command from BIND 9, to generate input files for nsupdate,
and probably the key values in them.

<p>
Although not required, GnuDIP will run a bit faster if you install
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Digest-MD5">
the Perl Digest-MD5 module</a>.

<p>
In order to use <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
rather than the Linux/UNIX file system for Web Tool
configuration and user information, you will also need:
<ul> 
<li>
<a href="http://mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html">
the MySQL database management software</a>
<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBI">
the Perl DBI module</a>
<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBD::mysql">
the DBI MySQL driver</a>
</ul>

<p>
In order to use <a href="http://postgresql.com/">PostreSQL</a>
rather than the Linux/UNIX file system for Web Tool
configuration and user information, you will also need:
<ul> 
<li>
<a href="http://www.postgresql.com/mirrors-ftp.html">
the PostreSQL database management software</a>
<li>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=DBI">
the Perl DBI module</a>
<li>
<a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/dbdpg/projdisplay.php">
the DBI PostgreSQL driver</a>
</ul>

<p>
If you have
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>
or such, Perl (including the DBI module), BIND and Sendmail will
probably be available as options from your installation CD. You may
need to obtain and install the rest.

<p>
Read <a href="INSTALL.html"><code>INSTALL.html</code></a> for instructions on
installing GnuDIP.

<p><hr>

<p>
Changes since Release 2.1.2 are discussed in the file
<a href="release.html"><code>release.html</code></a>.

<p><hr>

<p>
The protocol used between the client and the update server is described in the
file <a href="gnudip/html/protocol.html">gnudip/html/protocol.html</a>.

<p><hr>

<p>
This package includes a bare bones version of GnuDIP with no database
or web tool. There is a <u>single configuration file</u>, which includes the list
of host names and their passwords.
